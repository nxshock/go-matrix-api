The server will detect whether it is an ID or a JSON object by whether the first character is a "{" open brace. Passing the JSON inline is best suited to one off requests. Creating a filter using the filter API is recommended for clients that reuse the same filter multiple times, for example in long poll requests.

	SetPresence SetPresence `url:"set_presence,omitempty"` // Controls whether the client is automatically marked as online by polling this API. If this parameter is omitted then the client is automatically marked as online when it uses this API. Otherwise if the parameter is set to "offline" then the client is not marked as being online when it uses this API. When set to "unavailable", the client is marked as being idle. One of: ["offline", "online", "unavailable"]

Instead the client should keep two separate copies of the state: the one from the invite_state and one from the archived state. If the client joins the room then the current state will be given as a delta against the archived state not the invite_state.
